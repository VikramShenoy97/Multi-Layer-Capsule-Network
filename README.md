# Multi-Layer Capsule Network


Multi-Layer Capsule Network and its evaluation implemented by Vikram Shenoy, Alexander Chowdhury, and Harry Hartenstine.

## Getting Started


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Baseline Multi-Layer Capsule Network


This model was trained on Google Colab. To reproduce the results, follow the following instructions


```
1) Go to CapsNet_AT&T/MLCN
2) Copy the main.py file onto a Google Colab Cell
3) Upload the make_graph.py, att_MLCN.py, and utils.py file onto Google Colab
4) Change the mode from "Train" to "Test", "VPA" (Capsule Vector Perturbation Analysis), and "LVG" (Latent Vector Generation)
```


The above instructions apply to the other codes as well with some minor changes.

## Results

Results can be found in the Network Comparisons folder. One such result is displayed below.
